give it a variable name and adding a value to that name  
// Declare a variable "human" and initilize it with a value of an object that contains relevant properties.

// Create a function called covidVaccination that can take in that human object as an input and assign 
// it a new property that identifies that human as vaccinated.

// Create a constructor function for humans.

// Create 5 new humans.

// Vaccinate a couple of those humans and then store all of them in an array.

// Create a function called covidScreener that can take in an array of humans as an input, and check to
// see who has been vaccinated - have the function return a string identifying those humans who have and
